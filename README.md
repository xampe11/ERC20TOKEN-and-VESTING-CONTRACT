ERC20 Token Launch with Custom Vesting Schedule

**Project Deliverables:**

1. **ERC20 Token Development:**

   - Design and develop a secure ERC20 token following best practices.
   - Implement standard functions such as `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance`.
   - Ensure the token is optimized for minimal gas usage without compromising security.

2. **Vesting Schedule Implementation:**

   - Create a smart contract to manage the vesting of tokens over a predefined period.
   - Ensure the vesting schedule can handle different cliff periods, release intervals, and percentages.
   - The vesting contract should allow beneficiaries to claim tokens according to the vesting schedule automatically.
   - Include functionalities for early withdrawal penalties (if applicable) and proper handling of any remaining tokens post-vesting.

3. **Testing and Auditing:**

   - Thoroughly test the smart contracts on a testnet to ensure functionality and security.
   - Perform a comprehensive security audit to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.

4. **Documentation:**

   - Provide clear and concise documentation for both the ERC20 token and the vesting schedule contracts.
   - Include deployment instructions, explanations of the code, and guidelines for interacting with the contracts.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the ERC20 token and vesting schedule contracts on the Ethereum mainnet.
   - Ensure the contracts are properly initialized and integrated with the planned vesting schedule.
